1. I would like first of all to thank you for having me speak in front of you today. My name is Luciano Melodia and I am going to talk about homological analysis of time series data from power plants.

2. I belong to the Friedrich-Alexander University Erlangen-Nuremberg and I am doing my PhD under the professorship of evolutionary data management. Our project that I am presenting today is a cooperation of our Chair of Informatics 6, i6 for short, and Siemens Energy, who kindly provided the power plant data.

3. Let me start with a brief description of the upcoming content. Sensor data streams are named with a standardized labeling system. Unfortunately, this is not consistently used by power plant operators, which is why engineers today manually label sensor data streams when they want to analyze power plant data. This is the reason for our classifier, which aims to automate this task. Furthermore, I would like to briefly introduce the structure of the technical argument, how homology groups can be used and why we succeed in training our classifier with homology groups of dimension zero and one. At this point I have to assume prior knowledge about persistent homology, but I will be happy to clarify questions about it afterwards. We will assume that the time series lie on a 1-manifold, but since this is rather boring for homological analysis, we use an embedding we call sliding-window, which depends on two parameters, M and Tau, to represent the time series as a curve within a hypertorus. Its homology groups are informative and useful for us. Then I would like to show the architecture of the neural network we used and present the experimental results.

4. Let's start with the classification of power plant sensor data.

5. Here you can see the components of the labeling system. First of all, the overall plant is described by a letter or a number. The same procedure is used to code the functional units that form a related group of components within a power plant and describe them by means of an optional number, three letters and two additional numbers that enumerate the functional units. Aggregates are smaller subgroups of functional units. Thus, a hierarchical structure is used to encode the architecture of a power plant into the labels. Finally, two letters and two numbers are used to encode the actual unit to which the sensor is attached. Let me illustrate this with an example. Here the power plant block is coded with the number one. The functional unit is coded as main group 2L, which means the second steam, water and gas circuit. A is the feedwater system and C is the feedwater pump. Lastly, the numbers 0 and 3 describe that it is the third feedwater pump of the power plant. Analogous is done with the aggregates and operating resources.

6. Before we come to the theoretical foundation of our approach I would like to remind you of the so-called manifold assumption. This states that we may assume a one-dimensional, possibly smooth manifold underlying our set of points, which forms the time series for a sensor. Of course, this manifold would be homeomorphic to the realaxis and thus relatively boring with respect to homological investigations. Therefore, we embed the points in a higher-dimensional object whose homological properties encode certain properties of the manifold on which we have conjectured the data.
